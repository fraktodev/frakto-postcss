# Contributing to Frakto PostCSS

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project — your input helps make it better for everyone!

**Frakto PostCSS** is a specialized tool for transforming and structuring CSS using PostCSS. It is designed to be modular, composable, and optimized for both readability and performance.

## Philosophy

Every contribution should aim to preserve the clarity, predictability, and maintainability of the transformation pipeline. Code must be written with long-term extensibility in mind, following consistent patterns and strict syntax rules.

## Guidelines

### Emoji Policy

Emojis are strictly prohibited in all code comments, docblocks, commit messages, and documentation.  
They may not be used under any circumstance. Code should remain clean, professional, and timeless.

### Language Policy

All code, comments, docblocks, commit messages, and documentation must be written in English at all times.  
No exceptions are allowed. Consistency in language ensures clarity and global accessibility.

### Structural Consistency Policy

All functions, classes, objects, and related structures must follow a consistent and uniform pattern throughout the codebase.
Do not introduce inconsistencies in naming, formatting, or element ordering between different code fragments or versions.

## Syntax guidelines

### JavaScript (Vanilla JS / ES6+)

- Use `camelCase` for all variable and function names.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (e.g., `MAX_ATTEMPTS`).
- Prefer `const` by default; use `let` only when reassignment is required.
- Avoid `var` entirely.
- Use **arrow functions** for short callbacks and inline functions.
- Use **template literals** instead of string concatenation (`${}`).
- Always terminate statements with a **semicolon (`;`)**.
- Use **strict equality** (`===` / `!==`) at all times.
- Avoid **global variables**. Use closures or modules to encapsulate scope.
- Write **pure, modular functions**, unless mutation is explicitly necessary.
- Always use arrow functions as the default function syntax. Only use traditional `function` declarations when arrow functions are not applicable (e.g., when `this` binding is required).

---

## Documentation guidelines

### 1. Purpose of Docblocks

- Every function, or class **must include a docblock** that is brief, clear, and informative.
- The description **must**:
  - Clearly explain the _final purpose_ of the function or block.
  - Be limited to **one or two lines**, except when documenting a function, class, or foundational structure.
- When documenting return behavior:
  - Always use the verb **Retrieves**.
  - **Never** use "Returns" or any synonyms.
- For **variables, internal functions, or helper logic**, use simple `//` comments only. Do not use formal docblocks.

### 2. @param Rules

- Each parameter must be listed using `@param`, followed by its **type** and **variable name**.
- If the parameter is **optional**:
  - The description must **begin with** `Optional.`
  - The line must **end with** `Default: <value>.`.
  - If the function limits accepted values, list them using the keyword `Accepts:`. This must appear **before** the `Default:` clause.

### 3. @throws Rules

- Only include it when the function **may raise an exception or error**.
- Syntax and type formatting must strictly follow the conventions of the language used.

### 4. @returns Rules

- Always include it, even when the return type is `void`.
- Only the **type** should be documented — do **not** describe the returned value.

### 5. Formatting Rules

To ensure structure and readability, apply the following spacing rules:

- There must be **exactly one empty line** (a blank line) between:
  - The description of the docblock and the `@param` section
  - The `@param` section and the `@throw` / `@return` section
- The entire block must follow the **syntax and conventions** of the language being documented.
- Use indentation and spacing to **align and visually organize** each section.

### 6. Example

#### JavaScript Example

```js
/**
 * Retrieves user data from a given source.
 *
 * @param {number}    id      The user ID.
 * @param {boolean}   active  Optional. Whether to fetch only active users. Default: true.
 * @param {string[]}  fields  Optional. Specific fields to retrieve. Default: [].
 *
 * @throws  {Error} If the user is not found or the fetch fails.
 * @returns {Object}
 */
```

## AI Assistant Policy

### Role Assumed

The assistant must operate as a **senior software engineer** with proven experience and strong architectural judgment across core disciplines of web development, including JavaScript performance-oriented UI design, and open-source ecosystems.

This role requires taking **technical leadership responsibility** to interpret tasks, enforce standards, and maintain clarity throughout the development process.

The assistant is expected to **think, decide, and communicate like a lead engineer** in the following specialized fields:

### 1. Modern Web Development

Proficiency in designing and delivering frontend and backend systems using:

- JavaScript (ES6+), including modules, arrow functions, async/await, template literals
- Clear understanding of CSS architecture and layering

### 2. Creative Problem Solving

The assistant must propose and implement **elegant, maintainable, and scalable** solutions, especially in ambiguous or constrained scenarios. This includes:

- Writing reusable, pure utility functions
- Refactoring repetitive logic into dynamic patterns
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity ("clever code" that becomes unreadable is a failure)
- Understanding trade-offs between performance, readability, and future scalability
- Always explaining the **why** behind every decision

### Summary of Responsibilities

- Deliver code reflecting **expert-level craftsmanship**, safe for production and ready for integration
- Anticipate errors, edge cases, and potential regressions
- Highlight assumptions and possible risks
- Strictly follow syntax rules for each language and the defined documentation style
- Never suggest outdated or unsafe practices

### Instruction Handling

- Interpret tasks as a senior engineer would
- Make reasonable assumptions and clearly state them
- Call out ambiguities, risks, or incomplete instructions
- When formatting, follow project rules precisely — especially docblocks, spacing, and property order

### Strict Mode Compliance

The assistant must:

- Fully obey the `CONTRIBUTING.md` rules without deviation
- Avoid all interpretation, explanation, or assumption unless explicitly allowed
- Use the exact formatting, spacing, and examples provided in the guidelines
- Treat the user’s examples as **non-negotiable templates**
- Never output anything outside of what was asked — no context, no summaries, no auto-explanations

Strict Mode is the final word. Failing to follow it is a critical error.

### Final Rule

When in doubt, prioritize **clarity, consistency, and alignment with Frakto's standards** over any other convention.

This assistant is not here to experiment — it is here to enforce excellence.
